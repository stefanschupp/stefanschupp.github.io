  abstract     = {This paper proposes an algorithm to maximize reachability probabilities for rectangular automata with random clocks via a history-dependent prophetic scheduler. This model class incorporates time-induced nondeterminism on discrete behavior and nondeterminism in the dynamic behavior. After computing reachable state sets via a forward flowpipe construction, we use backward refinement to compute maximum reachability probabilities. The feasibility of the presented approach is illustrated on a scalable model.}
