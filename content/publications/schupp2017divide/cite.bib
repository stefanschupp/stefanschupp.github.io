      abstract    = {In this paper we propose an improvement for flowpipe-construction-based reachability analysis techniques for hybrid systems. Such methods apply iterative successor computations to pave the reachable region of the state space by state sets in an over-approximative manner. As the computational costs steeply increase with the dimension, in this work we analyse the possibilities for improving scalability by dividing the search space in sub-spaces and execute reachability computations in the sub-spaces instead of the global space. We formalise such an algorithm and provide experimental evaluations to compare the efficiency as well as the precision of our sub-space search to the original search in the global space.}
