  abstract     = {Since about two decades, formal methods for continuous and hybrid systems enjoy increasing interest in the research community. A wide range of analysis techniques were developed and implemented in powerful tools. However, the lack of appropriate benchmarks make the testing, evaluation and comparison of those tools difficult. To support these processes and to ease exchange and repeatability, we present a manifold benchmark suite for the reachability analysis of hybrid systems. Detailed model descriptions, classification schemes, and experimental evaluations help to find the right models for a given purpose.}
