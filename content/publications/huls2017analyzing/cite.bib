  abstract  = {Two approaches have been presented for the analysis of HPnGs, (i) a tree-based approach and (ii) a state-space representation based on computational geometry. We present a translation of the tree-based representation into a geometric representation using the C++ library HyPro, which has been developed for the analysis of hybrid automata. This allows the representation and efficient and accurate analysis of HPnGs with multiple stochastic firings.}
