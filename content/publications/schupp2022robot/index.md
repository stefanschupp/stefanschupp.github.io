abstract: "A swarm robotic system consists of a team of robots performing cooperative tasks without any centralized coordination. In principle, swarms enable flexible and scalable solutions; however, designing individual control algorithms that can guarantee a required global behavior is difficult. Formal methods have been suggested by several researchers as a mean to increase confidence in the behavior of the swarm. In this work, we propose to model swarms as hybrid systems and use reachability analysis to verify their properties. We discuss challenges and report on the experience gained from applying hybrid formalisms to the verification of a swarm robotic system."
