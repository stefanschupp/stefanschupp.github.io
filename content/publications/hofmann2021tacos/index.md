abstract: "We introduce TACoS, a tool for synthesizing controllers satisfying MTL specifications of undesired behavior with timing constraints. Our contribution extends an existing theoretical approach towards practical applications. The most notable features include: Online labeling to terminate early if a solution has been found, heuristic search to expand the most promising nodes first, search graph pruning to reduce the problem size by pruning irrelevant parts of the search graph, and reusing previously explored search nodes to further reduce the search graph. Finally, multi-threading support allows to make use of modern CPUs with many parallel threads. TACoS comes with a C++ library with minimal external dependencies and simple-to-use API. We evaluate our approach on a number of scenarios and investigate how each of the enhancements improves the performance.

The tool is publicly available at https://github.com/morxa/tacos."
