In this work, we have attempted to combine these two concepts to propose a tractable solution to model checking of hyperproperties expressed as HyperLTL on models involving nondeterminism. We have implemented our approach in PLASMA and experimented with a range of case studies to showcase its effectiveness.}

Our contribution extends an existing theoretical approach towards practical applications. The most notable features include: Online labeling to terminate early if a solution has been found, heuristic search to expand the most promising nodes first, search graph pruning to reduce the problem size by pruning irrelevant parts of the search graph, and reusing previously explored search nodes to further reduce the search graph. Finally, multi-threading support allows to make use of modern CPUs with many parallel threads. TACoS comes with a C++ library with minimal external dependencies and simple-to-use API. We evaluate our approach on a number of scenarios and investigate how each of the enhancements improves the performance.

The result of this verification is a set of states which is proven to be safe, called the recoverable region. During runtime, our Simplex architecture adapts towards a running advanced controller by exploiting proof-on-demand techniques. Verification of hybrid systems is often overly conservative, resulting in over-conservative recoverable regions that cause unnecessary switches to the baseline controller. To avoid these switches, we invoke targeted reachability queries to extend the recoverable region at runtime.

Our offline and online verification relies upon reachability analysis, since it allows observation-based extension of the known recoverable region. However, detecting fix-points for bounded liveness properties is a challenging task for most hybrid system reachability analysis tools. We present several optimizations for efficient fix-point computations that we implemented in the state-of-the-art tool HyPro that allowed us to automatically synthesize verified and performant Simplex architectures for advanced case studies, like safe autonomous driving on a race track.}

Nondeterminism, which is present in many purely hybrid models, is often only implicitly considered in SHA. This paper instead proposes algorithms for computing optimal reachability probabilities for singular automata with urgent transitions and random clocks which follow arbitrary continuous probability distributions. We borrow a well-known approach from hybrid systems reachability analysis, namely flowpipe construction. We extract those valuations of random clocks which ensure reachability of specific goal states from the computed flowpipes and compute reachability probabilities by integrating over these valuations. We compute maximal and minimal probabilities for history-dependent prophetic and non-prophetic schedulers using set-based methods. A case study featuring a series of nondeterministic choices shows the feasibility of the approach.}

In principle, swarms enable flexible and scalable solutions; however, designing individual control algorithms that can guarantee a required global behavior is difficult.

In this work, we propose to model swarms as hybrid systems and use reachability analysis to verify their properties. We discuss challenges and report on the experience gained from applying hybrid formalisms to the verification of a swarm robotic system.}
