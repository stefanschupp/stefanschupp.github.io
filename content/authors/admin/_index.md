## About me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at RWTH Aachen University, more specific in the group [Theory of hybrid systems](http://www.ths.rwth-aachen.de) led by Prof. Dr. Erika Ábrahám. 
I did my PhD in this group, working on the topic of safety verification of hybrid systems. 
My research in this area focusses on state set representations used in flowpipe-construction-based reachability analysis for linear hybrid systems.
